## Part II: Research Design

**Intro / Overview**  
1. Introduction to research design    
2. Testing the Program Hypothesis   
    1. Treatment groups (ANOVA, t-test, regression with dummies) 
    1. Treatment levels (regression) 
    1. Treatment categories (chi-square) 
4. Validity (moved reliability to end) 
    1. Internal 
    1. External 
    1. Type I and Type II Errors 
5. Power 
    1. Sample size  
    1. Measurement error in DV and IV  
6. Threats to Internal Validity  
    1. Sample design  
      1. Selection in (unobserved heterogeneity, omitted variable bias) 
      1. Selection out (attrition)  
    1. Trends in the data 
      1. Maturation 
      1. Secular trends 
      1. Seasonality 
      1. Regression to the mean 
      1. Testing effects / Hawthorn effects 
    1. Study calibration 
      1. Study time-frame  
      1.  Measurement error 
    1. Contamination 
      1. Intervening effects 
      1. Diffusion of treatment 


**Counterfactual Analysis** 
7. The three counterfactuals 
    1. Pre-post with control (difference-in-difference) 
      1. Can test for equivalence of groups before treatment 
      1. Can test for secular trends 
      1. Can estimate the counterfactual 
      1.  Can test for treatment effects 
    1. Post-test only (requires equivalent groups to be valid) 
    1. Pre-post reflexive (requires absence of trends) 
8. Construction of a counterfactual 
    1. Equivalent groups 
      1. RCT 
      1. Matching 
        1. Observable versus non-observable heterogeneity  
      1. Reflexive design  
      1. Test for equivalence (comparison of sample means, bonferoni corrections) 
        1. In reflexive design, test would be for non-random attrition 
    1. Non-equivalent groups  
      1. What can we say in this case?
    1. Use of difference-in-difference with non-equivalent groups
      1. Parallel lines assumption need to construct a valid counterfactual
    1. Using comparison group to create upper or lower bounds
      1. Use of bias formula to determine direction of bias
9. Treatment fidelity 
    1. Intention to treat estimate 
    1. Treatment-on-treated estimate 
    1. Challenges with diffusion of treatment, individuals switching groups 
10. Attrition 
    1. Random attrition – impacts power, not bias (leads to type ii errors) 
    1. Non-random attrition – introduces bias 
    1. Tests for each 
      1. Comparison of study group means after attrition 
      1. Comparison of those that leave across groups 
      1. Comparison of leavers and stayers within groups 
      1. Comparison of rates of attrition across groups  
 
**Research Design**  
11. Experimental methods  
    1. Randomization / true control groups  
    1. Limitations (ethics, can’t randomize gender, etc.)  
    1. Challenges to implementation  
12. Natural experiments (external events that act like experiments)  
    1. Lotteries  
    1. Stages roll-out of policies  
    1. Earthquakes, policy change, etc.  
13. Non-experimental methods  
    1. Observational  
    1. Naturalistic  
14. Quasi-experiments  
    1. Post-test only  
       1. Requires equivalent comparison groups  
       1. Propensity score matching   
       1. Regression discontinuity models (summer school example)  
    1. Reflexive Studies   
       1. Requires arguments or tests for absence of trend (no gains independent of treatment)  
       1. Interrupted time-series models  
    1. Pre-post with comparison  
       1. Difference-in-difference models  
       1. Interrupted time-series with comparison group  
15. Advanced experimental design   

**Data Collection**  
16. Reliability   
17. Measurement Error  
18. Surveys  
19. Interview methods
