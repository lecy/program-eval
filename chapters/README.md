## Part II: Research Design

**Intro / Overview**
1.	Introduction to research design
2.	Testing the Program Hypothesis
  a.	Treatment groups (ANOVA, t-test, regression with dummies)
  b.	Treatment levels (regression)
  c.	Treatment categories (chi-square)
4.	Validity (moved reliability to end)
  a.	Internal
  b.	External
  c.	Type I and Type II Errors
5.	Power
  a.	Sample size
  b.	Measurement error in DV and IV
6.	Threats to Internal Validity
  a.	Sample design
    i.	Selection in (unobserved heterogeneity, omitted variable bias)
    ii.	Selection out (attrition)
  b.	Trends in the data
    i.	Maturation
    ii.	Secular trends
    iii.	Seasonality
    iv.	Regression to the mean
    v.	Testing effects / Hawthorn effects
  c.	Study calibration
    i.	Study time-frame 
    ii.	Measurement error
  d.	Contamination
    i.	Intervening effects
    ii.	Diffusion of treatment


**Counterfactual Analysis**
7.	The three counterfactuals
  a.	Pre-post with control (difference-in-difference)
    i.	Can test for equivalence of groups before treatment
    ii.	Can test for secular trends
    iii.	Can estimate the counterfactual
    iv.	Can test for treatment effects
  b.	Post-test only (requires equivalent groups to be valid)
  c.	Pre-post reflexive (requires absence of trends)
8.	Construction of a counterfactual
  a.	Equivalent groups 
    i.	RCT 
    ii.	Matching
      1.	Observable versus non-observable heterogeneity
    iii.	Reflexive design
    iv.	Test for equivalence (comparison of sample means, bonferoni corrections)
      1.	In reflexive design, test would be for non-random attrition
  b.	Non-equivalent groups 
    i.	What can we say in this case?
    ii.	Use of difference-in-difference with non-equivalent groups
      1.	Parallel lines assumption need to construct a valid counterfactual
    iii.	Using comparison group to create upper or lower bounds
      1.	Use of bias formula to determine direction of bias
9.	Treatment fidelity
  a.	Intention to treat estimate
  b.	Treatment-on-treated estimate
  c.	Challenges with diffusion of treatment, individuals switching groups
10.	Attrition
  a.	Random attrition – impacts power, not bias (leads to type ii errors)
  b.	Non-random attrition – introduces bias
  c.	Tests for each
    iii.	Comparison of study group means after attrition
    iv.	Comparison of those that leave across groups
    v.	Comparison of leavers and stayers within groups
    vi.	Comparison of rates of attrition across groups

**Research Design**
11.	Experimental methods
  a.	Randomization / true control groups
  b.	Limitations (ethics, can’t randomize gender, etc.)
  c.	Challenges to implementation
12.	Natural experiments (external events that act like experiments)
  a.	Lotteries
  b.	Stages roll-out of policies
  c.	Earthquakes, policy change, etc.
13.	Non-experimental methods
  d.	Observational
  e.	Naturalistic
14.	Quasi-experiments
  a.	Post-test only
    i.	Requires equivalent comparison groups 
    ii.	Propensity score matching 
    iii.	Regression discontinuity models (summer school example)
  b.	Reflexive Studies 
    i.	Requires arguments or tests for absence of trend (no gains independent of treatment)
    ii.	Interrupted time-series models
  c.	Pre-post with comparison
    i.	Difference-in-difference models
    ii.	Interrupted time-series with comparison group
15.	Advanced experimental design
